# Design

## Colour Scheme

The color scheme for Diving Center is carefully crafted to evoke a warm, inviting, and diving-inspired atmosphere. Here's a detailed breakdown:

[Colors by looka.com](https://looka.com/editor/188707413) - Colour Scheme for Diving Center website

![Palette](doc/colors/diving-space-colors.png)

The Diving Center's color scheme is a carefully curated palette that evokes the essence of underwater exploration and marine environments. Here's a unique description of the color scheme:

The Diving Center's visual identity is anchored by a rich array of blues, complemented by warm golden hues and crisp neutrals. This thoughtfully designed color palette creates an immersive digital experience that mirrors the allure of the ocean depths.

At the heart of the scheme is **Ocean Blue (#1172B8)**, a deep, saturated hue that serves as the primary color. This shade evokes the vast expanse of the open sea, instilling a sense of adventure and exploration throughout the website.

**Sunlit Waves (#158FE7)** adds a vibrant, energetic touch to the design. This bright blue, reminiscent of sun-dappled waters, is used for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons, guiding users through their journey on the site.

Providing depth and grounding is **Abyss Blue (#0D5589)**, a darker shade that anchors the design and creates a sense of the mysterious underwater world.

Balancing the cool blues are warm, sandy tones. **Golden Sand (#C7AE6A)** and **Sun-Bleached Shore (#D5C28F)** add warmth and contrast, evoking images of tropical beaches and sun-soaked dive spots. These colors are used for accents and highlights, bringing a touch of sunlight to the oceanic palette.

**Treasure Gold (#B99A45)** serves as a special accent color, perhaps used for premium features or to highlight important information. It adds a touch of luxury and discovery, like finding hidden treasures beneath the waves.

The palette is completed with classic **Black (#000000)** and **White (#FFFFFF)**. These provide sharp contrast and clarity, ensuring excellent readability for text and creating clean spaces within the design.

This unique color scheme not only captures the essence of diving but also enhances usability. The contrast between the deep blues and warm golds creates visual interest and guides users through the site, while the neutral black and white ensure clarity and accessibility. Together, these colors create an immersive digital environment that beckons diving enthusiasts to explore, connect, and dive deeper into their passion.

## Fonts

Diving Center employs fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=dm%20sans), specifically the DM Sans family, to create a cohesive and visually appealing design across our platform. This modern, sans-serif typeface offers excellent readability and a clean, professional appearance that aligns perfectly with our diving-themed website.

### Palette

**DM Sans**  

**Usage:** Headings, titles, and emphasis  

**Characteristics:** DM Sans boasts a perfect equilibrium of fluid contours and bold strokes, embodying both approachability and professionalism in its design.

**Reason for Selection:** The distinctive character of DM Sans encapsulates the spirit of diving exploration â€“ a fusion of adventure and expertise. Its clean yet dynamic style emphasizes key information, guiding divers through our platform while evoking a sense of aquatic wonder and technical proficiency.

**DM Sans on Google Fonts**

![Palette](doc/fonts/dm-sans.png)

By leveraging the crisp legibility of DM Sans, Diving Center crafts a typographic journey that resonates with underwater enthusiasts. Each character, phrase, and paragraph invites users to dive in, discover, and connect with the vast tapestry of marine life, diving techniques, and underwater narratives that make the diving world so captivating. The font's versatility allows for clear communication of both technical diving information and engaging storytelling, creating an immersive digital experience that mirrors the depth and diversity of the ocean itself.

### Backup Font

In the event that DM Sans is unavailable due to browser limitations or other reasons, a generic **sans-serif** font will be used as a fallback. Sans-serif fonts are characterized by their clean and minimalistic appearance, lacking the decorative strokes (serifs) found in traditional serif fonts. This ensures that text remains legible and maintains a modern aesthetic, providing a consistent user experience across different platforms and devices. The absence of serifs contributes to improved readability, especially on digital screens, making sans-serif fonts a reliable choice for web design.

### Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### Database Schema

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![Entity Relationship Diagram](doc/erd/erd.png)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the database structure for the Diving Center project. It illustrates the relationships between different entities (tables) and their attributes (columns). The ERD helps in understanding the data organization and facilitates efficient database design.

Click to exploer the [Diving Center API - DataBase](https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/DivingCenter_API/blob/main/README.md#data-models)

#### Tables Overview

In the Diving Center project, the ERD consists of the following entities:

### Entities

| Entities | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| User | Manages user authentication and basic information |
| Profile | Extends user information with additional details and preferences |
| Courses | Stores information about available diving courses, including details like title, description, type, and price |
| Bookings | Handles course reservations made by users, including date, time, and additional information |
| Reviews | Allows users to rate and review courses, with content and rating |
| Posts | Manages user-generated content for the community feed, including images and filters |
| Comments | Enables users to comment on posts, with creation and update timestamps |
| Likes | Tracks user likes on posts, with creation timestamps |
| Followers | Manages user follow relationships, tracking who follows whom |
| Contact Us| Stores customer inquiries and messages, including a deletion token for privacy |

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### Relationships

The relationships between these models create a cohesive system:

- Users are linked to Profiles, Bookings, Reviews, Posts, Comments, Likes, and Followers.
- DivingCourses are connected to Bookings and Reviews.
- Posts are associated with Comments and Likes.
- Followers establish connections between users.

The following tables illustrates the relationships between different models in the system. It shows how users are connected to various other entities like profiles, bookings, reviews, posts, comments, likes, and followers. It also demonstrates the connections between diving courses and their bookings and reviews, as well as the relationship between posts and their comments and likes. Lastly, it represents the follower relationship between users.

| Model 1 | Relationship | Model 2 |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| User | has one | Profile |
| User | has many | Bookings |
| User | has many | Reviews/Ratings (through Courses) |
| User | has many | Posts |
| User | has many | Comments |
| User | has many | Likes |
| User | has many | Followers |
| User | has many | Contacts |
| User | follows many | User |
| Courses | has many | Bookings |
| Courses | has many | Reviews/Ratings |
| Post | has many | Comments |
| Post | has many | Likes |
| Post | belongs to | User |
| Comment | belongs to | User |
| Like | belongs to | User |
| Follower | belongs to | User |

The ERD provides a clear understanding of the data structure and relationships within the Diving Center project, facilitating efficient database design and development.

### Security

The "Diving Center" project, built with a React frontend and Django REST framework backend, prioritizes the security of the user information. We have implemented robust measures to protect against unauthorized access or misuse of users data.

### Authorized Access

Only authorized users with the appropriate permissions can view or modify sensitive information within the application, ensuring that the data is only accessible to those who are supposed to have access.

### Secure Code

The codebase is developed with security best practices in mind to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. This includes secure handling of user authentication and data validation.

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is a critical security measure implemented in the "Diving Center" project. It prevents attackers from tricking authenticated users into executing unwanted actions on a web application without their consent[1]. Django, the backend framework used in this project, provides built-in CSRF protection by default. This protection works by including a unique, secret token in each form and checking that token on form submission.

For more detailed information on CSRF protection in Django, you can visit the [official Django documentation on CSRF](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/csrf/).

### JWT Authentication

JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is employed in the "Diving Center" project for secure user authentication. JWTs are an open standard (RFC 7519) that define a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. In this project, JWTs are used to manage user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.

The Django REST framework, used in the backend, supports JWT authentication through libraries like `dj-rest-auth`. This implementation ensures that each request from an authenticated user includes a JWT, which the server verifies before processing the request.

For more information on JWT and its implementation in Django REST framework, you can refer to the [official JWT website](https://jwt.io/) and the [dj-rest-auth documentation](https://dj-rest-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#jwt-support-optional).

These security measures work together to provide a robust defense against common web application vulnerabilities, ensuring the safety and integrity of user data in the "Diving Center" application.

### Secure Storage

Sensitive files and media in the "Diving Center" project are securely stored using Cloudinary, a cloud-based image and video management service. Cloudinary provides robust security measures to protect user data both in transit and at rest.

Key security features of Cloudinary include:

1. Data encryption: All data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using AES-256 encryption)[1].

2. Access control: Cloudinary offers various access control mechanisms, including signed URLs and access control lists (ACLs), to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources[1].

3. Compliance: Cloudinary complies with major security standards and regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001[1].

4. Secure API: All interactions with Cloudinary's API are done over HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between the application and Cloudinary's servers[1].

5. Asset backup: Cloudinary maintains multiple backups of all assets, protecting against data loss[1].

By leveraging Cloudinary's secure storage solutions, the "Diving Center" project ensures that user-uploaded images, videos, and other media files are protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.

For more detailed information on Cloudinary's security measures and best practices, you can visit the [official Cloudinary Security documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/security).

### Continuous Monitoring

The team behind "Diving Center" continuously monitors the application for potential security threats and regularly updates the codebase to address any new vulnerabilities.

### Privacy Commitment

Understanding the importance of protecting the privacy and personal details of all users, the "Diving Center" team makes data security a top priority throughout the development process.

By implementing these comprehensive security measures, the "Diving Center" project aims to provide a safe and trustworthy platform for all users.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### CRUD functunalities

The "Diving Center" project, built with a React frontend and Django REST framework backend, leverages Django's robust tools to manage Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities securely and efficiently.

**Django Class-Based Views**

Django's class-based views simplify the implementation of CRUD operations. These views handle common tasks such as viewing, editing, and deleting information, making it easier to write and maintain code for these operations.

**Authentication System**

Django's authentication system ensures that only logged-in users can perform certain actions. This system includes mixins like `LoginRequiredMixin` and `UserPassesTestMixin`, which work with class-based views to enforce access control. These mixins ensure that only authenticated users can access specific views and perform actions like editing or deleting data.

**Permissions**

Custom permissions are implemented to further secure CRUD operations. For instance, the `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` permission class ensures that only the owner of an object can modify or delete it, while others can only view it.

```python
from rest_framework import permissions

class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True
        return obj.owner == request.user
```

**Serializers**

Serializers in Django REST framework handle the conversion between complex data types and JSON, making it easy to validate and transform data. Custom serializers, like `CurrentUserSerializer`, extend existing serializers to include additional fields.

```python
from dj_rest_auth.serializers import UserDetailsSerializer
from rest_framework import serializers

class CurrentUserSerializer(UserDetailsSerializer):
    profile_id = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.id')
    profile_image = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.image.url')

    class Meta(UserDetailsSerializer.Meta):
        fields = UserDetailsSerializer.Meta.fields + ('profile_id', 'profile_image')
```

**Views**

Custom views handle the logic for CRUD operations. For example, the `ContactListCreateView` and `ContactDetailView` manage the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of contact messages.

```python
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, AllowAny
from .serializers import ContactSerializer
from .models import Contact
from uuid import uuid4

class ContactListCreateView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    serializer_class = ContactSerializer

    def get_queryset(self):
        if self.request.user.is_authenticated:
            if self.request.user.is_staff:
                return Contact.objects.all()
            return Contact.objects.filter(email=self.request.user.email)
        return Contact.objects.none()

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.request.method == 'POST':
            return [AllowAny()]
        return [IsAuthenticated()]

    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        serializer.save(deletion_token=uuid4())
```

**Frontend Integration**

The React frontend interacts with the Django backend through API calls, allowing users to perform CRUD operations. For example, the `ContactForm` component handles form submission, editing, and deletion of contact messages.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Form from 'react-bootstrap/Form';
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
import Modal from 'react-bootstrap/Modal';
import { axiosReq } from '../../api/axiosDefaults';
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import styles from '../../styles/ContactForm.module.css';
import Asset from '../../components/Asset';

const ContactForm = () => {
  // State and handlers for form submission, editing, and deletion
  // ...
  return (
    <div className={styles.ContactForm}>
      <h2 className={styles.Title}>{isEditing ? 'Edit Your Message' : 'Contact Us'}</h2>
      <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        {/* Form fields and buttons */}
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ContactForm;
```

By integrating Django's class-based views, authentication system, custom permissions, and serializers with a React frontend, the "Diving Center" project ensures secure and efficient management of CRUD functionalities. For more information on Django's class-based views and authentication system, you can visit the [official Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/class-based-views/).

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### Authentication and Authorization

The "Diving Center" project makes it very simple for new users to create accounts and existing users to log in. This is achieved using Django Allauth, a powerful authentication system integrated into the Django backend. With Django Allauth, the signup and login processes are seamless and user-friendly, allowing users to quickly become part of the "Diving Center" community and start exploring all the features right away.

#### Key Features:

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Users can easily register for a new account or log in to an existing one through intuitive forms provided by Django Allauth.
   - The React frontend includes components like `SignUpForm` and `SignInForm` to handle these processes.

2. **JWT Authentication:**
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication, ensuring that user sessions are managed securely.
   - The backend employs libraries like `dj-rest-auth` to support JWT, enhancing security and user experience.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Custom permissions, such as `IsOwnerOrReadOnly`, ensure that only authorized users can modify or delete specific resources.
   - The React frontend uses context (e.g., `useCurrentUser`) to manage the current user's state and enforce access control.

4. **Protected Routes:**
   - Certain routes are protected and require user authentication. For example, the route to create a booking (`/bookings/create`) redirects unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.

5. **User Feedback:**
   - The application uses `react-toastify` to provide real-time feedback to users, such as success or error messages during authentication and authorization processes.

#### Example Code:

**Backend: Permissions**

```python
from rest_framework import permissions

class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True
        return obj.owner == request.user
```

**Frontend: Authentication Forms**

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useCurrentUser } from '../../contexts/CurrentUserContext';
import SignUpForm from './SignUpForm';
import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

const AuthRoutes = () => {
  const currentUser = useCurrentUser();
  const history = useHistory();

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route
        exact
        path="/signin"
        render={() =>
          currentUser ? <Redirect to="/bookings/create" /> : <SignInForm />
        }
      />
      <Route exact path="/signup" component={SignUpForm} />
    </Switch>
  );
};

export default AuthRoutes;
```

By integrating Django Allauth with JWT authentication and custom permissions, the "Diving Center" project ensures a secure and user-friendly authentication and authorization process. This allows users to easily join the community and access the features they need while keeping their data secure.

For more information on Django Allauth and its capabilities, you can visit the [official Django Allauth documentation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### Data Validation and Sanitization

Ensuring the accuracy and safety of the data entered into forms is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the "Diving Center" project. This process involves validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent the submission of incorrect or harmful information, whether by mistake or malicious intent.

#### Data Validation

Data validation is implemented both on the frontend and backend to ensure that user inputs meet the required criteria before being processed or stored. In the React frontend, form validation can be handled using state and effect hooks to provide real-time feedback to users.

**Example: Booking Form Validation**

```javascript
const handleUpdate = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const { id, date, time, course } = editingBooking;
  const formattedDate = new Date(date).toISOString().split('T')[0];
  if (checkExistingBooking(formattedDate, time, course, id)) {
    toast.warning('You already have a booking for this course, date, and time. Please try again.');
  } else {
    setEditingBooking({ ...editingBooking, date: formattedDate });
    setShowUpdateConfirmation(true);
  }
};
```

On the backend, Django REST framework serializers are used to validate data before saving it to the database. Custom validators can be added to ensure that all inputs conform to the expected formats and constraints.

**Example: Contact Serializer**

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Contact

class ContactSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Contact
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'email', 'subject', 'message', 'created_at', 'deletion_token']
        read_only_fields = ['id', 'deletion_token', 'created_at']
        extra_kwargs = {
            'name': {'help_text': 'Enter your full name'},
            'email': {'help_text': 'Enter a valid email address'},
            'subject': {'help_text': 'Enter the subject of your message'},
            'message': {'help_text': 'Enter your message here', 'style': {'base_template': 'textarea.html', 'rows': 4}},
        }
```

#### Data Sanitization

Data sanitization involves cleaning user inputs to remove any potentially harmful content, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is typically handled by the backend before storing or processing the data.

**Example: Sanitizing User Inputs**

In Django, data sanitization can be achieved using built-in functions and middleware that automatically escape harmful characters and scripts.

```python
from django.utils.html import escape

class Contact(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    message = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    deletion_token = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.name = escape(self.name)
        self.email = escape(self.email)
        self.subject = escape(self.subject)
        self.message = escape(self.message)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```

By implementing robust data validation and sanitization processes, the "Diving Center" project ensures that all user inputs are accurate, safe, and secure, protecting the application and its users from potential threats and maintaining smooth operation.

#### Error Handling

### Error Handling

The "Diving Center" project implements comprehensive error handling mechanisms across both the frontend and backend to ensure a smooth user experience, even when issues arise. This approach uses clear, user-friendly messages and appropriate visual cues to guide users through any unexpected situations.

#### Frontend Error Handling

In the React frontend, error handling is implemented through various methods:

1. **Custom Error Pages:**
   The project includes a custom `NotFound` component that is displayed when users navigate to non-existent pages. This component uses diving-themed humor to lighten the mood while guiding users back to the main site:

   ```jsx
   const NotFound = () => {
     return (
       <div className={styles.NotFound}>
         <div className={styles.NotFoundContent}>
           <img src={NoResults} alt="No results" />
           <p>
             Our apologies, this page must have gotten eaten by a shark! Surface
             and head back to the home page.
           </p>
         </div>
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Toast Notifications:**
   The application uses `react-toastify` to display user-friendly error messages. For example, in the `BookingPage` component:

   ```javascript
   catch (err) {
     toast.error('Failed to load bookings. Please try again.');
   }
   ```

3. **Conditional Rendering:**
   Components use conditional rendering to display appropriate content based on the application's state, including error states:

   ```jsx
   if (loading) {
     return <Spinner animation="border" />;
   }

   if (bookings.length === 0) {
     return (
       <p>You have no bookings. Would you like to create one?</p>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Error Boundaries:**
   React error boundaries could be implemented to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree and display fallback UI.

#### Backend Error Handling

On the Django REST framework backend, error handling is managed through several mechanisms:

1. **Serializer Validation:**
   Serializers validate incoming data and return detailed error messages. For example, in the `ContactSerializer`:

   ```python
   class ContactSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
       class Meta:
           model = Contact
           fields = ['id', 'name', 'email', 'subject', 'message', 'created_at', 'deletion_token']
           read_only_fields = ['id', 'deletion_token', 'created_at']
           extra_kwargs = {
               'name': {'help_text': 'Enter your full name'},
               'email': {'help_text': 'Enter a valid email address'},
               # ...
           }
   ```

2. **Exception Handling in Views:**
   Views include try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully. For instance, in the `ContactDetailView`:

   ```python
   def destroy(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
       instance = self.get_object()
       if instance is None:
           return Response(
               {"error": "You don't have permission to delete this message"},
               status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN
           )
       # ...
   ```

3. **Custom Permissions:**
   Custom permission classes, like `IsOwnerOrReadOnly`, provide specific error messages when access is denied:

   ```python
   class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
       def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
           if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
               return True
           return obj.owner == request.user
   ```

4. **HTTP Status Codes:**
   The backend uses appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of errors, which the frontend can interpret and display accordingly.

By implementing these error handling strategies, the "Diving Center" project ensures that users receive clear, helpful guidance when encountering issues, maintaining a positive user experience even in the face of errors or unexpected situations. The diving-themed error messages add a touch of personality to the application, aligning with its overall theme and potentially easing user frustration during error scenarios.

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### Environment Security

Keeping important information safe is crucial in the "Diving Center" project. This includes sensitive data such as database addresses, secret keys, and cloud storage links.

#### Development Phase

During the development phase, these sensitive details are stored in a special file called `.env.py`. This file contains environment variables and is not shared with others to protect the information. Hereâ€™s an example of how sensitive information is managed in the Django settings:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import dj_database_url

if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')
}
```

#### Production Phase

When the project is deployed for production, the sensitive information is stored using environment variables. This approach makes it harder for unauthorized individuals to access or misuse the information. Additionally, the `DEBUG` setting is turned off to enhance security:

```python
DEBUG = False

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOST'),
    'your-production-domain.com',
]

DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

By taking these steps, the "Diving Center" project ensures that sensitive data is well-protected and cannot be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals. This practice helps maintain the security and integrity of the project.

#### Example Code for Environment Variables

**Backend: Django Settings**

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import dj_database_url

BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent

# Load environment variables from .env.py if it exists
if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'

ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    os.getenv('ALLOWED_HOST'),
    'localhost',
]

DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
}

CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.getenv('CLOUDINARY_URL')
}
```

[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

#### CSRF Protection

The "Diving Center" project takes security seriously, especially when it comes to protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF protection is implemented to ensure that unauthorized commands are not executed on behalf of authenticated users without their knowledge.

#### How CSRF Protection Works

CSRF protection involves using a secret code called a "CSRF token." This token is like a password that gets sent with every form submission on the website. It helps verify that the request is coming from an authenticated user and not from a malicious third-party site.

#### Implementation in the Project

**Backend (Django):**

In Django, CSRF protection is enabled by default. The framework automatically includes a CSRF token in forms and checks it on form submission to ensure the request is legitimate.

**Frontend (React with Axios):**

In the React frontend, Axios is configured to include the CSRF token in all requests. This ensures that the backend can verify the authenticity of the requests.

Hereâ€™s how Axios is configured in the project:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://your-api-url.com/';
axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'multipart/form-data';
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

export const axiosReq = axios.create();
export const axiosRes = axios.create();
```

By including the CSRF token in every request, the "Diving Center" project ensures that all interactions with the backend are secure and protected from CSRF attacks.

For more information on CSRF protection in Django, you can visit the [official Django documentation on CSRF](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csrf/).

---

### Example Code for CSRF Protection

**Django Settings:**

In the Django settings, CSRF protection is enabled by default. However, you can customize CSRF settings as needed:

```python
# settings.py

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'
```

**React with Axios:**

In the React frontend, Axios is configured to include credentials (cookies) with every request, ensuring that the CSRF token is sent along with form submissions:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://your-api-url.com/';
axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'multipart/form-data';
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

export const axiosReq = axios.create();
export const axiosRes = axios.create();
```

By implementing these security measures, the "Diving Center" project ensures that sensitive operations are protected from CSRF attacks, maintaining the integrity and security of user data.

## Responsiveness

### Screens of All Sizes

![Am I Responsive Image](doc/images/amiresponsive/amiresponsive.png)

The "Diving Center" website is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. This responsive design is achieved through a combination of Bootstrap's grid system and custom CSS modules.

### Bootstrap Integration

We utilize Bootstrap's responsive grid system to ensure that the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. This approach minimizes the need for extensive media queries and custom breakpoints.

Example of Bootstrap grid usage in our `BookingPage` component:

```jsx
<Container className={styles.bookingPage}>
  <Row>
    <Col md={8} lg={6}>
      <h2 className={styles.bookingTitle}>Your Bookings</h2>
      {/* Booking list content */}
    </Col>
    <Col md={4} lg={6}>
      {/* Sidebar or additional content */}
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Custom CSS Modules

While Bootstrap provides a solid foundation, we've implemented custom CSS modules for each component to maintain a unique and cohesive design throughout the application. This approach allows for component-specific styling while avoiding global style conflicts.

Example of a custom CSS module (`BookingPage.module.css`):

```css
.bookingPage {
  padding: 20px;
}

.bookingTitle {
  color: #0056b3;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.bookingItem {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 15px;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .bookingItem {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```

### React Components and Styling

Our React components are designed with responsiveness in mind. We use a combination of Bootstrap components and custom-styled elements to create a consistent and adaptive user interface.

Example of responsive component design:

```jsx
const BookingItem = ({ booking }) => (
  <div className={styles.bookingItem}>
    <Row>
      <Col xs={12} md={6}>

### Responsive Images

We ensure that images are responsive and optimized for different devices:

```jsx
<img
  src={course.image}
  className={`${styles.rowImage} img-fluid`}
  alt={course.title}
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.src = '../images/courses/default.webp';
  }}
/>
```

### Mobile-First Approach

Our styling approach follows the mobile-first principle, ensuring that the base styles are optimized for mobile devices and then enhanced for larger screens.

By combining Bootstrap's responsive framework with custom React components and CSS modules, the "Diving Center" website delivers a seamless and visually appealing experience across all devices. This approach not only enhances user experience but also streamlines development and maintenance processes.

  [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
  - **Setting up on Heroku:**
    Here's a simplified 10-step explanation on how to use Heroku's cloud server to deploy your "Diving Center" coffee project, written in easy-to-understand language for non-coders:

1. **Sign up for Heroku**: Go to heroku.com and create an account.

2. **Create a new app**: After logging in, click on the "New" button in the top right corner and select "Create New App". Give your app a unique name and choose your preferred region.

3. **Connect to GitHub**: In the "Deploy" section, select "GitHub" as the deployment method. Search for your "Diving Center" repository and connect it to Heroku.

4. **Set up environment variables**: In the "Settings" section, click on "Reveal Config Vars". Here, you'll need to add some important variables:

   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your Django project (you can generate one online).
   - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your database (e.g., Heroku Postgres).
   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: The URL for your Cloudinary account (for storing images and media).

5. **Enable automatic deploys**: In the "Deploy" section, you can choose to enable automatic deploys from your GitHub repository. This means Heroku will automatically update your app whenever you push new changes to GitHub.

6. **Deploy your app**: If you didn't enable automatic deploys, you can manually deploy your app by scrolling down to the "Manual Deploy" section and clicking "Deploy Branch".

7. **Open your app**: After a successful deployment, Heroku will provide you with a unique URL where your "Diving Center" app is now live! You can click the "View" button to open it.

8. **Set up a database**: If your app requires a database, you'll need to provision one. Heroku recommends using Heroku Postgres, which you can set up through the "Resources" section of your app's dashboard.

9. **Update your code**: If you need to make changes to your app, simply commit and push the updates to your GitHub repository. If you enabled automatic deploys, Heroku will automatically update your live app. Otherwise, you'll need to manually re-deploy.

10. **Monitor your app**: Heroku provides tools to monitor your app's performance, logs, and other metrics. You can access these through the "More" menu in your app's dashboard.

By following these steps, you'll be able to deploy your "Diving Center" coffee project to Heroku's cloud server, making it accessible to anyone with the app's URL. Remember to consult Heroku's documentation or seek help if you encounter any issues during the deployment process.

- Procfile

You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:

- **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt**

**The Procfile can be created with the following command:**

echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

## CI database

- **Database Hosting:** The Code Institute (CI) database systems are employed to store and manage the application's data during development and deployment phases. For Code Institute students only.

## Cloudinary

To enhance performance and scalability, the project utilizes a third-party service for hosting and serving static media files like images. This approach alleviates the burden on the primary hosting platform, ensuring efficient delivery of content to users.

- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary is used for hosting media files like images. It removes the load of serving static files from Heroku, ensuring better performance and scalability. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
  - **Integration:**
    1. Set up a Cloudinary account.
    2. Configure the Cloudinary settings in the Django settings file with the API keys provided by Cloudinary.
    3. Use Djangoâ€™s storage backend for Cloudinary to handle media uploads.

By adopting this approach, the project benefits from a dedicated and optimized infrastructure for managing and delivering static media content. This not only improves the overall user experience but also facilitates future growth and expansion by providing a scalable solution for handling an increasing volume of media assets.

3. **Create Your Fork**: Click on the "Fork" button. GitHub will prompt you to select the destination account for your forked repository. Choose your personal GitHub account or an organization you have access to. click the green button "Create fork".

4. **Wait for the Forking Process**: GitHub will initiate the forking process, creating a complete copy of the "Diving Center" repository under your chosen account or organization. This process may take a few moments, depending on the size of the repository.

5. **Navigate to Your Forked Repository**: Once the forking process is complete, you'll be automatically redirected to the forked repository's page within your account or organization. The URL will reflect the new location of your forked repository.

6. **Customize Your Fork (Optional)**: You now have full control over your forked repository. You can rename it, modify the description, or make any other desired changes to distinguish it from the original repository.
