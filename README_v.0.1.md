# Design

## Colour Scheme

The color scheme for Diving Center is carefully crafted to evoke a warm, inviting, and diving-inspired atmosphere. Here's a detailed breakdown:

[Colors by looka.com](https://looka.com/editor/188707413) - Colour Scheme for Diving Center website

![Palette](doc/colors/diving-space-colors.png)

The Diving Center's color scheme is a carefully curated palette that evokes the essence of underwater exploration and marine environments. Here's a unique description of the color scheme:

The Diving Center's visual identity is anchored by a rich array of blues, complemented by warm golden hues and crisp neutrals. This thoughtfully designed color palette creates an immersive digital experience that mirrors the allure of the ocean depths.

At the heart of the scheme is **Ocean Blue (#1172B8)**, a deep, saturated hue that serves as the primary color. This shade evokes the vast expanse of the open sea, instilling a sense of adventure and exploration throughout the website.

**Sunlit Waves (#158FE7)** adds a vibrant, energetic touch to the design. This bright blue, reminiscent of sun-dappled waters, is used for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons, guiding users through their journey on the site.

Providing depth and grounding is **Abyss Blue (#0D5589)**, a darker shade that anchors the design and creates a sense of the mysterious underwater world.

Balancing the cool blues are warm, sandy tones. **Golden Sand (#C7AE6A)** and **Sun-Bleached Shore (#D5C28F)** add warmth and contrast, evoking images of tropical beaches and sun-soaked dive spots. These colors are used for accents and highlights, bringing a touch of sunlight to the oceanic palette.

**Treasure Gold (#B99A45)** serves as a special accent color, perhaps used for premium features or to highlight important information. It adds a touch of luxury and discovery, like finding hidden treasures beneath the waves.

The palette is completed with classic **Black (#000000)** and **White (#FFFFFF)**. These provide sharp contrast and clarity, ensuring excellent readability for text and creating clean spaces within the design.

This unique color scheme not only captures the essence of diving but also enhances usability. The contrast between the deep blues and warm golds creates visual interest and guides users through the site, while the neutral black and white ensure clarity and accessibility. Together, these colors create an immersive digital environment that beckons diving enthusiasts to explore, connect, and dive deeper into their passion.

### Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

#### Database Schema

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![Entity Relationship Diagram](documentation/erd/entity-relationship-diagram.png)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the database structure for the Diving Center project. It illustrates the relationships between different entities (tables) and their attributes (columns). The ERD helps in understanding the data organization and facilitates efficient database design.

#### Tables Overview

In the Diving Center project, the ERD consists of the following entities:

### Entities

1. **User**: This entity stores user information such as username, email, password, and other relevant details.

2. **Post**: This entity represents the posts or content created by users. It may include attributes like post title, content, date, and author (linked to the User entity).

3. **Like**: This entity tracks the likes given by users on posts. It may have attributes like the user who liked the post and the post that was liked.

4. **Favorite**: This entity stores the posts marked as favorites by users. It may have attributes like the user who favorited the post and the post that was favorited.

5. **Review**: This entity represents the reviews or ratings given by users for posts. It may include attributes like the review text, rating score, and the user who wrote the review.

6. **Comment**: This entity stores the comments made by users on posts. It may have attributes like the comment text, date, and the user who posted the comment.

7. **Contact**: This entity stores contact information submitted by users through a contact form. It may include attributes like name, email, message, and date.

#### Relationships

The relationships between these entities are as follows:

- **User** has a one-to-many relationship with **Post**, **Like**, **Favorite**, **Review**, and **Comment**, meaning a user can have multiple posts, likes, favorites, reviews, and comments.
- **Post** has a one-to-many relationship with **Like**, **Favorite**, **Review**, and **Comment**, meaning a post can have multiple likes, favorites, reviews, and comments.
- **Like** has a many-to-one relationship with **User** and **Post**, indicating that a like is associated with one user and one post.
- **Favorite** has a many-to-one relationship with **User** and **Post**, indicating that a favorite is associated with one user and one post.
- **Review** has a many-to-one relationship with **User** and **Post**, indicating that a review is associated with one user and one post.
- **Comment** has a many-to-one relationship with **User** and **Post**, indicating that a comment is associated with one user and one post.

The ERD provides a clear understanding of the data structure and relationships within the Diving Center project, facilitating efficient database design and development.

### Security

The "Diving Center" coffee project takes keeping your information safe very seriously. The developers have put in place strong protections to guard against bad people trying to access or misuse your data.

Only authorized users with the proper permissions can view or make changes to sensitive information within the application. The code that runs the app is also written in a secure way to prevent any vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by hackers.

One such protection is against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF protection ensures that unauthorized commands are not executed on behalf of authenticated users without their knowledge. This safeguard prevents malicious sites from tricking users into performing unwanted actions, thereby keeping your data secure.

The team behind "Diving Center" understands how important it is to protect the privacy and personal details of all users. That's why they have made data security one of their top priorities throughout the development process.

#### CRUD functunalities

 Django has special tools that make sure only the right people can view add, change or delete information on a website. These tools work together to keep everything safe and secure. First, there are "class-based views" that handle the basic actions like viewing, editing, and deleting information. 

These views make it easy to write code for common tasks.
Next, Django has an "authentication system" that checks if a user is logged in or not. If they are not logged in, it won't let them do certain things like edit or delete information. 

This authentication system has special mixins called "LoginRequiredMixin" and "UserPassesTestMixin". These mixins work with the class-based views to make sure that only logged-in users can perform certain actions.

If a user tries to do something they are not allowed to do, like edit someone else's information, the mixins will stop them. Instead of letting them do the wrong thing, the mixins will redirect the user to the login page.

This way, Django's tools work together to keep the website secure and prevent people from doing things they shouldn't be doing. It's like having a security guard that only lets the right people through the door.

#### Authentication and Authorization

 The "Diving Center" coffee project makes it very simple for new users to create accounts and existing users to log in. This is possible thanks to a special tool called "Django Allauth." With "Django Allauth," signing up and logging in happens smoothly and without any problems. Users don't have to worry about complicated steps or confusing instructions. They can easily become part of the "Diving Center" community and start exploring all the fun features right away!

#### Data Validation and Sanitization

 Checking the information people type into forms is very important. It helps make sure the data is correct and safe. This way, no one can put in bad or harmful information by mistake or on purpose. Validating forms protects the project and keeps everything working properly.

#### Error Handling

 When something goes wrong with the website, special pages are shown. These pages help explain the problem in a friendly way. They use simple words and pictures to make it easy for everyone to understand what happened. This way, if there is an issue, users won't feel lost or confused. The special pages will guide them and let them know what's going on in a clear and helpful manner.

#### Environment Security

 Keeping important information safe is very important in this project. This includes things like database addresses, secret codes, and cloud storage links.

During the building phase, these details are kept in a special file called .env.py. This file is not shared with others to protect the information.

When the project is ready to be used by people, the important information is stored in a different way called configurable variables. This makes it harder for anyone to see or misuse the information. It also turns off a setting called debug mode, which makes the project even more secure.By taking these steps, the project makes sure that sensitive data is well-protected and cannot be easily accessed by anyone who should not have access to it.

#### CSRF Protection

 Keeping Bad People Out: The coffee website has a special way to stop bad people from doing bad things. It uses a secret code called a "CSRF token." This code is like a password that gets sent with every form you fill out on the website. This secret code helps keep the website safe from people trying to do bad things.

## Responsiveness

### Screens of All Sizes

![responsiveness](documentation/amireponsive/cupsofjoy.png)

The "Diving Center" website works well on different devices like phones, tablets, and computers. This was done by using special code called Bootstrap. Bootstrap helps make websites look good on any screen size without needing too much extra code.

Instead of writing many lines of code for different screen sizes, Bootstrap has a simple way to make the website adjust itself automatically. This means the website will look great whether you're using a small phone screen or a big computer monitor.

By using Bootstrap's smart design, the "Diving Center" website can be easily viewed and used on any device. This was an excellent chance to practice using Bootstrap and make the website work smoothly everywhere with just a little bit of code.

# Deployment

The "Diving Center" project leverages a combination of platforms and services to facilitate its deployment and management.

For hosting and running the application, Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS), is utilized. It enables seamless deployment, automatic scaling, and management tools for monitoring and maintaining the application. The Code Institute (CI) database systems are employed to store and manage the application's data during development and deployment phases.

Additionally, Cloudinary, a cloud-based service, is integrated to handle image and video management, providing an end-to-end solution for storing, optimizing, and delivering media assets for the "Diving Center" platform.
The respective URLs for these platforms and services are as follows:

  - **Setting up on Heroku:**
Here's a simplified 10-step explanation on how to use Heroku's cloud server to deploy your "Diving Center" coffee project, written in easy-to-understand language for non-coders:

1. **Sign up for Heroku**: Go to heroku.com and create an account.

2. **Create a new app**: After logging in, click on the "New" button in the top right corner and select "Create New App". Give your app a unique name and choose your preferred region.

3. **Connect to GitHub**: In the "Deploy" section, select "GitHub" as the deployment method. Search for your "Diving Center" repository and connect it to Heroku.

4. **Set up environment variables**: In the "Settings" section, click on "Reveal Config Vars". Here, you'll need to add some important variables:
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your Django project (you can generate one online).
   - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your database (e.g., Heroku Postgres).
   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`: The URL for your Cloudinary account (for storing images and media).

5. **Enable automatic deploys**: In the "Deploy" section, you can choose to enable automatic deploys from your GitHub repository. This means Heroku will automatically update your app whenever you push new changes to GitHub.

6. **Deploy your app**: If you didn't enable automatic deploys, you can manually deploy your app by scrolling down to the "Manual Deploy" section and clicking "Deploy Branch".

7. **Open your app**: After a successful deployment, Heroku will provide you with a unique URL where your "Diving Center" app is now live! You can click the "View" button to open it.

8. **Set up a database**: If your app requires a database, you'll need to provision one. Heroku recommends using Heroku Postgres, which you can set up through the "Resources" section of your app's dashboard.

9. **Update your code**: If you need to make changes to your app, simply commit and push the updates to your GitHub repository. If you enabled automatic deploys, Heroku will automatically update your live app. Otherwise, you'll need to manually re-deploy.

10. **Monitor your app**: Heroku provides tools to monitor your app's performance, logs, and other metrics. You can access these through the "More" menu in your app's dashboard.

By following these steps, you'll be able to deploy your "Diving Center" coffee project to Heroku's cloud server, making it accessible to anyone with the app's URL. Remember to consult Heroku's documentation or seek help if you encounter any issues during the deployment process.

**For deployment Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.**
- requirements.txt
- Procfile
  
You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:

- **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt**

**The Procfile can be created with the following command:**

echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

## CI database
- **Database Hosting:** The Code Institute (CI) database systems are employed to store and manage the application's data during development and deployment phases. For Code Institute students only.

## Cloudinary

To enhance performance and scalability, the project utilizes a third-party service for hosting and serving static media files like images. This approach alleviates the burden on the primary hosting platform, ensuring efficient delivery of content to users. 

- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary is used for hosting media files like images. It removes the load of serving static files from Heroku, ensuring better performance and scalability. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
  - **Integration:**
    1. Set up a Cloudinary account.
    2. Configure the Cloudinary settings in the Django settings file with the API keys provided by Cloudinary.
    3. Use Django’s storage backend for Cloudinary to handle media uploads.

By adopting this approach, the project benefits from a dedicated and optimized infrastructure for managing and delivering static media content. This not only improves the overall user experience but also facilitates future growth and expansion by providing a scalable solution for handling an increasing volume of media assets.

# Cloning and Forking

## Cloning the Repository
- **Local Setup:**
  1. Clone the repository: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/Cups-of-Joy). 
 `git clone https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/Cups-of-Joy`.
  2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd software-stacks-p4`
  3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  4. Set up local environment variables in a `.env` file.
  5. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
  6. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

1. **Open Your Preferred Code Editor**: Launch the code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) you typically use for your coding projects.

2. **Navigate to the Repository URL**: Visit the following URL in your web browser: https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/Cups-of-Joy

3. **Locate the Clone Button**: On the repository page, you'll find a green-colored button labeled "Code". Click on this button to reveal the cloning options.

4. **Copy the Repository URL**: Depending on your preferred cloning method, copy the repository URL provided. You can choose either the HTTPS, SSH URL or GitHub CLI based on your setup and preferences.

5. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: In your code editor or operating system, open a terminal or command prompt window. This will allow you to execute Git commands.

6. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**: Using the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory or folder where you want to clone the "Diving Center" repository. You can use the `cd` command followed by the path to change directories.

7. **Execute the Clone Command**: Once you're in the desired directory, execute the following Git command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL you copied earlier:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

   Press Enter, and Git will start cloning the repository to your local machine.

8. **Install requirements**: Install requirements from requirements.txt using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt". If working in a virtual environment, activate the virtual environment before running the command.

9. **Create env.py**: Create a env.py to store database url, secret key and cloudinary url. directory:

## Forking the Repository

Here's an original step-by-step guide for forking the "Diving Center" project from the GitHub repository located at https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/Cups-of-Joy:

1. **Navigate to the Repository**: Open your web browser and visit the "Diving Center" repository at https://github.com/AmirShkolnik/Cups-of-Joy.

2. **Locate the Fork Button**: On the top-right corner of the repository page, you'll find a button labeled "Fork". This button allows you to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

3. **Create Your Fork**: Click on the "Fork" button. GitHub will prompt you to select the destination account for your forked repository. Choose your personal GitHub account or an organization you have access to. click the green button "Create fork". 

4. **Wait for the Forking Process**: GitHub will initiate the forking process, creating a complete copy of the "Diving Center" repository under your chosen account or organization. This process may take a few moments, depending on the size of the repository.

5. **Navigate to Your Forked Repository**: Once the forking process is complete, you'll be automatically redirected to the forked repository's page within your account or organization. The URL will reflect the new location of your forked repository.

6. **Customize Your Fork (Optional)**: You now have full control over your forked repository. You can rename it, modify the description, or make any other desired changes to distinguish it from the original repository.
